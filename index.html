        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p class="byline">By Evan Wild</p>

        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
          self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
          renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision?
          In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>

        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
          then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in
          urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as you'll
          find out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.
        </p>

        <table>
          <caption>Comparison of wild and urban bears</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>
              <th scope="col">Coat</th>

            </tr>
          </thead>

            <tr>
              <td>Wild</td>
              <td>Brown or black</td>
              <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
              <td>Woods and forests</td>
              <td>25 to 28 years</td>
              <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Urban</td>
              <td>North Face</td>
              <td>1.8 to 2.2 meters</td>
              <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>

        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general they
          will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from
          farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban
          creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily
          available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban
          bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals,
          and microwave ovens.
        </p>

        <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to fast-food restrooms, to their own apartment.</p>

          along with samples and quotes from experts.

          <p>
            Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "in to" wildlife since childhood.
            He once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
          </p>
          <p>He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound cool.</p>

                  Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                  little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all
                  in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
